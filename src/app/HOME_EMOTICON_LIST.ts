      "If you want to create joyful, happy or laughing Japanese emoticons use high up eyes. For example, you can use these characters: ^, ￣, ´ and `. Mouths are important too. Japanese girls often use character ω (omega) for mouths of their emoticons, thinking that such kaomoji are cute, or, as they say, kawaii. You can also use ∀, ▽ and other characters resembling a smile. And Japanese also like to add different effects to kaomoji (stars, tears of joy, and so on) for better emphasis.",

In addition, you can add 'wrinkles' ＃ and their stronger forms: メ or ╬; and 凸 (middle finger) and ψ (claws) as an arm. You can also use 'snarl' 皿 or 益.",
