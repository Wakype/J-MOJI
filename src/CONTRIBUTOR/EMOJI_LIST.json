Japanese girls often use character ω (omega) for mouths of their emoticons, thinking that such kaomoji are cute, or, as they say, kawaii. You can also use ∀, ▽ and other characters resembling a smile. And Japanese also like to add different effects to kaomoji (stars, tears of joy, and so on) for better emphasis.",
